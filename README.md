# Esd.ABH

This is an extension to the [P1 Project](https://github.com/emil0212/Aalborg-University-Software/tree/main/Project-P1)
made by a group and I at Aalborg University. The aim of the project is to develop a software application in the C
programming language that facilitates automatic bargain hunting. The application will allow users to input a shopping
list and search for the lowest total price of the items on the list at nearby stores.

### Extension

The application will be extended to include a local text-based database with a login/registration/menu system and a
graphical user interface (GUI) implemented using the Sokol and Cimgui libraries.

### Personal goals

The objective of this project was to enhance my skills in the C programming language by designing and implementing a
custom user interface using the Cimgui library. This project served as an opportunity to challenge myself and deepen my
understanding of the C programming language.

### IDE

For this project, the 'Clion' Integrated Development Environment (IDE) by [JetBrains](https://www.jetbrains.com/) was
utilized. 'Clion' is a cross-platform IDE that is specifically designed for C and C++ development. It offers a range of
features including code navigation, code refactoring, debugging, and code completion, which make it a powerful tool for
developing C and C++ applications. 'Clion' also integrates with popular build systems such as CMake and Gradle, allowing
for easy compilation and execution of projects. Overall, 'Clion' proved to be a reliable and efficient choice for this
project.
